What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new git repository is created when I initialize a repository.
I think this is the first step to create an online git repository on the cloud.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A staging area has files and changes that are not yet committed to the repository.
Also all the files in the working directory need not be in the staging area.
Hence staging area is an intermediate stage between a working directory and the repository.
This helps us to organize the edits and files better.
