When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I want to share my work with others and also when I need to have 
a copy of my work saved on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

First of all I have multiple branches on repository, and I can decide which branch do I need to stay in
sync with. I also dont want to loose changes I am working on, in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repositories that we can copy from other public repositories. Clone is a copy of repository, we 
can create either from an online Github source or from a local repository. Branch is an independent
 copy of the whole repository in the local repository itself.
